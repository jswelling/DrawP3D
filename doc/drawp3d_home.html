<p>
DrawP3D is a subroutine library for doing scientific visualization.
It was originally developed in connection with the 
<A HREF="http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/p3d/p3d.html">P3D</A>
format for describing 3D models (hence the name), but it has since
outgrown P3D to become a very versatile package in its own right.
In addition to the P3D format, VRML and Open Inventor formats are
now supported.  This means that 3D models produced by DrawP3D can
be included in Web pages and viewed with standard VRML browsers.
Interactive output
to X Windows and to Silicon Graphics GL is also provided.
<p>
The package can produce isosurfaces, Z surfaces,
axes and the like from gridded, irregular, and randomly scattered data,
plus basic graphical primitives like polygons, spheres, and cylinders.
DrawP3D does not currently support texture mapping, but has a very general
notion of color maps.  Using this feature, isosurfaces and Z surfaces
can be colored based on a secondary field value.
<p>
One particularly nice feature of DrawP3D is its ability to run in
a distributed fashion using 
<A HREF="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM</A>.
(<a href=/general/software/packages/pvm/pvm.html>Here</a> is the PSC's
PVM documentation.)
Given a workstation running 
<A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/Inventor.html">Silicon Graphics 
Open Inventor</A>
as a display server, geometry from multiple parallel processes can be 
merged into a single display.  A display tool is also available on
request to
allow DrawP3D to transmit to a 
<A HREF="http://www.evl.uic.edu:80/EVL/VR/systems.html#CAVE">CAVE-type</A> 
virtual environment using
<A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/Performer/">Silicon Graphics 
Performer</A>.  This means that DrawP3D can easily be used to tie
ongoing computations into a VR environment.  Development of the distributed
version of DrawP3D was supported by the 
<a href=http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/GC3_Home_Page.html>
Grand Challenge Cosmology Consortium</a>.

<p>
DrawP3D was developed at the <A HREF="http://www.psc.edu/">Pittsburgh 
Supercomputing Center</A> with major support from the 
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A>.
